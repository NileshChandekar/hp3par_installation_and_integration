# Hpelefthand Installation and Deployment with Integration of Packstack-10/RHOSP-10/RHOSP-13

Tested and working on all above Openstack Environemnt.

## Warning

For RHOSP-13, Hpelefthand lefthand is not supported as its a containerized environment.
There are some tweak to make it work.

We will not take you throught the process of Packstack-10/OSP10/13 installation.


What's included
---------------
* Hpelefthand Installtion on KVM
* Static IP Configuration of Hpelefthand
* CMC Installtion on Lubuntu (as CMC required GUI, we decided to take light weight GUI)
* Connect CMC with Hpelefthand
* User Management, RAID Creation,
* Integration of Hpelefthand with Openstack (Packstack-10/RHOSP-10 & RHOSP-13)
* Testing

Prerequisites
--------------------------
* To Begin with installation make sure you fulfill the following prerequisites
  - Minimum of one node to add into cluster
  - Node Specifications: 4Gb RAM, 3*10GB Disk(which should be added once VSA node is ready)
  - Hpe LeftHand setup tar file
    - HPE_StoreVirtual_KVM_VSA_and_StoreVirtual_FOM_Installer_TA688-10554.tgz

Hpelefthand Installation steps

Integration with Openstack Environemnt :-
------------------------------------------
As openstack is widely used cloud product.So it becomes necessary to have storage backened attached to our environment. Openstack supports various storage providers drivers. One of them is Hpelefthand/hpelefthand.
We might face challenges in intergatin those storages with our environments. This document will guide you how to integrate hpelefthand with Packstack, RHOSP10 and RHOSP13.


The templates for RHOSP10 and RHOSP13 is uploaded on this repository.
Also cinder.conf for packstack is uploaded too.

~~~
To run openstack commands for any component in RHOSP10 and RHOSP13 source overcloudrc file
To restart any service in RHOSP13 check the container id on controller node and restart container
`docker restart container_id`
To run openstack commands for any component in Packstack source `keystonerc_admin` file
~~~

Following are the steps important drivers need to installed in your environment to enable hpelefthand.

~~~
# yum install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm -y
# yum install python-pip -y
# pip install --upgrade pip
# pip install 'python-lefthandclient>=2.1,<3.0'
~~~

Where to install above driver is explained in detail according to the environment.

Packstack Integration :-
------------------------
 * If you have packstack deployed environment, its become easy to integrate hpelefthand with it.
 * The only thing you need to do is edit cinder.conf and install hpelefthand client on packsatck node.
 * Below are steps to integrate hpelefthand with packstack
~~~
# vi /etc/cinder/cinder.conf
~~~
* Add the following lines and change values as per your environment

    <img src="images/pack01.png" width="600" />

* Also enable hpeleftand as backened in cinder.conf

     <img src="images/pack02.png" width="600" />

* Install the drivers of hpelefthand client as you can in above section.

* Restart the cinder-volume service
~~~
systemctl restart openstack-cinder-volume
~~~

* Then check cinder service list after sourcing keystone_admin file

RHOSP-10 Integration :-
-----------------------
* I haved installed RHOSP10 using director.
* In RHOSP10 we have all services as systemd service

* To integrate hpelefthand with rhosp10 we need to create customize templates the templates for osp10 is uploaded on this repo have a look on it

* Check the contents of custom-env.yaml file in rhosp10_hpelefthand.tar
* Make necessry changes as your environment and include this environment file in your deployment command (** for reference check deploy.sh script given in the tar**).
* Hit the deployment command
* Once your deployment is complete to undercloud and source overcloudrc file.
    ~~~
    $ source overcloudrc
    ~~~
* Then check the cinder services
    ~~~
    $ cinder service-list
    ~~~
    - If you see that your your hpelefthand down, like below output
~~~
+------------------+----------------------------+------+---------+-------+----------------------------+-----------------+
| Binary           | Host                       | Zone | Status  | State | Updated_at                 | Disabled Reason |
+------------------+----------------------------+------+---------+-------+----------------------------+-----------------+
| cinder-scheduler | hostgroup                  | nova | enabled | up    | 2018-11-28T06:55:18.000000 | -               |
| cinder-volume    | hostgroup@tripleo-lefthand | nova | enabled | down  | 2018-11-28T06:55:23.000000 | -               |
| cinder-volume    | hostgroup@tripleo_iscsi    | nova | enabled | down  | 2018-11-27T10:57:28.000000 | -               |
+------------------+----------------------------+------+---------+-------+----------------------------+-----------------+
~~~
* Then go on controller node and install pip over that node
~~~
# yum install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm -y
# yum install python-pip -y
# pip install --upgrade pip
# pip install 'python-lefthandclient>=2.1,<3.0'
~~~

* In above commands we can see that we install python-hpe client because if your check cinder-volume logs you will find an error msg for hpelefthand driver not installed

~~~
# less /var/log/cinder/volume.log
~~~

* Restart cinder volume service so to apply the latest changes

~~~
# systemctl restart openstack-cinder-volume
~~~

* Then Again if you check that cinder service list you will see the cinder-volume service is up for hpelefthand

~~~
+------------------+----------------------------+------+---------+-------+----------------------------+-----------------+
| Binary           | Host                       | Zone | Status  | State | Updated_at                 | Disabled Reason |

+------------------+----------------------------+------+---------+-------+----------------------------+-----------------+
~~~

#####[Note: I have kept my lvm service down thats why its shows hostgroup@tripleo_iscsi down in your case it might be up]


RHOSP-13 Integration :-
-----------------------
* In RHOSP13 we have defaults templates at /usr/share/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates/environments

~~~
/usr/share/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates/environments/cinder-hpelefthand-config.yaml
~~~

* Copy that file in /home/stack/templates/

~~~
(overcloud) [stack@undercloud environments]$ cp cinder-hpelefthand-config.yaml /home/stack/templates/
~~~

* Change the values in `cinder-hpelefthand-config.yaml` as per your cluster

~~~
resource_registry:
  OS::TripleO::Services::CinderHPELeftHandISCSI: /usr/share/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates/puppet/services/cinder-hpelefthand-iscsi.yaml

parameter_defaults:
  CinderHPELeftHandISCSIApiUrl: 'https://192.168.122.110:8081/lhos'
  CinderHPELeftHandISCSIUserName: 'hpe'
  CinderHPELeftHandISCSIPassword: 'hpe12345'
  CinderHPELeftHandISCSIBackendName: 'tripleo_hpelefthand'
  CinderHPELeftHandISCSIChapEnabled: false
  CinderHPELeftHandClusterName: 'hp'
  CinderHPELeftHandDebug: True
~~~

* In RHOSP13 we have containerized overcloud.
* So before deployment we need to modify cinder-volume container
* Follow the steps given below

~~~
$ cd /home/stack/
$ mkdir cinder-hpe
$ cat Dockerfile
FROM 192.0.2.1:8787/rhosp13/openstack-cinder-volume:13.0-62
USER root
RUN sudo  curl -O http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
RUN sudo rpm -ivh epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
RUN sudo yum install -y python-pip --skip-broken
RUN sudo pip install --upgrade pip
RUN sudo pip install 'python-lefthandclient'
~~~
Search for cinder-volume in overcloud_images.yaml, copy the full path and write it in Dockerfile near `FROM` section

* This Dockerfile will install hpelefthand client inside cinder-volume container.
* Run the following commands and modify according to your environment.
~~~
$ docker build --rm -t 192.0.2.1:8787/rhosp13/openstack-cinder-volume:workaround /home/stack/cinder-hpe
$ docker push 192.0.2.1:8787/rhosp13/openstack-cinder-volume:workaround
$ docker images | grep workaround
~~~

* Now open overcloud_images.yaml and replace the image path to workaround
~~~
 DockerCinderSchedulerImage: 192.0.2.1:8787/rhosp13/openstack-cinder-scheduler:13.0-64
 DockerCinderVolumeImage: 192.0.2.1:8787/rhosp13/openstack-cinder-volume:workaround
 DockerClustercheckConfigImage: 192.0.2.1:8787/rhosp13/openstack-mariadb:13.0-61
~~~

* Run the deployment command now including the `cinder-hpelefthand-config.yaml` environment file.

~~~
openstack overcloud deploy --templates -e /home/stack/templates/node-info.yaml -e /home/stack/templates/overcloud_images.yaml -e /usr/share/openstack-tripleo-heat-templates/environments/network-isolation.yaml -e /home/stack/templates/network-environment.yaml -e /home/stack/templates/cinder-hpelefthand-config.yaml --ntp-server 192.0.2.1
~~~

* Lets create a volume and attach it to instance

* Initially there is no volume created other than system reserved

    <img src="images/vol001.png" width="600" />

* Lets Create a volume of 5GB

    <img src="images/vol01.png" width="600" />

    <img src="images/vol02.png" width="600" />

* Create an instance and verify there is no volume attached

    <img src="images/vol03.png" width="600" />

* Now attach a volume to an instance

    <img src="images/vol04.png" width="600" />

    <img src="images/vol05.png" width="600" />

* ssh into an instance and mount the attached volume to an instance

  In my case it is cirros instance and it has floating ip `192.168.122.116`

~~~
$ ssh cirros@192.168.122.116
~~~

* Once you get into he instance hit following commands to attach a volume

~~~
$ sudo -i
# lsblk
~~~

 <img src="images/vol09.png" width="600" />

~~~
# mkdir /data
# mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdb
# mount /dev/vdb /data/
~~~
 <img src="images/vol06.png" width="600" />

* Lets add some data inside that attached volume

    <img src="images/vol07.png" width="600" />

    <img src="images/vol08.png" width="600" />

###### We can see that size of used space increased.
